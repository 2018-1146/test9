                <p>‘We’ve got bad news for you. There’s been an 
                    accident, and . . . your son, . . . your son has been killed.’
                </p>
                <p> A father in Barcelona (Spain) writes:
                     “Back in the Spain of the 1960’s, we were a happy family. 
                     There were María, my wife, and our three children, David, Paquito, and Isabel, 
                     aged 13, 11, and 9 respectively.
                    <br><br>“One day in March 1963, Paquito came home from school complaining of severe head pains. 
                    We were baffled as to what could be the cause​—but not for long. Three hours later 
                    he was dead. A cerebral hemorrhage had snuffed out his life.
                    <br>“Paquito’s death took place over 30 years ago. Even so, the deep pain 
                    of that loss stays with us to this day. There is no way that parents can 
                    lose a child and not feel that they have lost something of themselves​—regardless
                    of how much time passes or how many other children they may have.”
                    <br><br>These two experiences, where parents lost children, 
                    illustrate how deep and lasting the wound is when a child dies. 
                    How true the words of a doctor who wrote: “The death of a child 
                    is usually more tragic and traumatic than the death of an older 
                    person because a child is the last person in the family expected 
                    to die. . . . The death of any child represents the loss of future 
                    dreams, relationships [son, daughter-in-law, grandchildren], 
                    experiences . . . that have not yet been enjoyed.” And this sense 
                    of deep loss can also apply to any woman who has lost a baby 
                    through miscarriage.
                    <br><br>A bereaved wife explains: “My husband, Russell, had 
                    served as a medical aide in the Pacific theater during World War II. 
                    He had seen and survived some terrible battles. 
                    He came back to the United States and to a more tranquil life. 
                    Later he served as a minister of God’s Word. In his early 60’s he 
                    began to have symptoms of a heart problem. He tried to lead an active life. 
                    Then, one day in July 1988, he suffered a massive heart attack and died. 
                    His loss was devastating. I never even got to say good-bye. 
                    He was not just my husband. He was my best friend. We had shared 
                    40 years of life together. Now it seemed that I had to face a special loneliness.”
                    <br><br>These are just a few of the thousands of tragedies 
                    that strike families throughout the world every day. 
                    As most grieving persons will tell you, when death takes your 
                    child, your husband, your wife, your parent, your friend, 
                    it is truly what the Christian writer Paul called it, 
                    “the last enemy.” Often the first natural reaction to 
                    the dreadful news may be denial, “It can’t be true! 
                    I don’t believe it.” Other reactions often follow, 
                    as we will see.
                    <br><br>However, before we consider the feelings 
                    of grief, let us answer some important questions.
                     Does death mean the end of that person? Is there 
                     any hope that we can see our loved ones again?​</p>
                     <h1>There Is a Real Hope</h1>
                    <p>The Bible writer Paul offered hope of relief 
                        from that “last enemy,” death. He wrote: 
                        “Death is to be brought to nothing.” 
                        “The last enemy to be abolished is death.” 
                        (1 Corinthians 15:26, The New English Bible) 
                        Why could Paul be so sure of that? Because he 
                        had been taught by one who had been raised 
                        from the dead, Jesus Christ. (Acts 9:3-19) 
                        That is also why Paul could write: 
                        “Since death is through a man [Adam], 
                        resurrection of the dead is also through a man 
                        [Jesus Christ]. For just as in Adam all are dying, 
                        so also in the Christ all will be made alive.”​
                        <br>​<br>Jesus was deeply grieved when he met a widow of Nain 
                        and saw her dead son. The Bible account tells us: 
                        “As [Jesus] got near the gate of the city [Nain], 
                        why, look! there was a dead man being carried out, 
                        the only-begotten son of his mother. Besides, she was a widow.
                         A considerable crowd from the city was also with her. 
                         And when the Lord caught sight of her, he was moved with pity 
                         for her, and he said to her: 
                         ‘Stop weeping.’ With that he approached and touched the bier, 
                         and the bearers stood still, and he said: ‘Young man, 
                         I say to you, Get up!’ And the dead man sat up and started to speak,
                          and he gave him to his mother. Now fear seized them all, 
                          and they began to glorify God, saying:  
                          ‘A great prophet has been raised up among us,’ and,
                           ‘God has turned his attention to his people.’”
                            Notice how Jesus was moved with pity, so that he resurrected 
                            the widow’s son! Imagine what that portends for the future!</p><br><br>
